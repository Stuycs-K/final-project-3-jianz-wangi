## **Rail Fence Cipher**
is a transposition cipher, **not** substitution cipher, that arranges the plaintext into a zig zag pattern and read in rows starting from the top to bottom (also known as zig zag cipher)  

A **Substitution Cipher** replaces characters from the plaintext into other characters or symbols.

A **Transposition Cipher** scrambles the order of the characters in the plaintext. Characters remain the same.
