## **Rail Fence Cipher**
is a transposition cipher, **not** substitution cipher, that arranges the plaintext into a zig zag pattern and read in rows starting from the top to bottom (also known as zig zag cipher)  

A **Substitution Cipher** replaces characters from the plaintext into other characters or symbols.

A **Transposition Cipher** scrambles the order of the characters in the plaintext. Characters remain the same.

### **History**
Transposition ciphers were originally invented by the ancient Greeks using the a tool, called the **scytale**.
Now, we've simplified the process to using pen and paper.

### **How it Works** 
rail fence cipher rows and columns    



**Advantages:**  
- simple and easy to encode
- don't need a program

**Disadvantages:**
- weak, can be easily brute forced
- limitation of key = half the length of the message
- letter frequencies are the same as unencrpted messages
