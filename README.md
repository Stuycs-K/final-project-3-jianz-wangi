# Rail Fence Cipher
## by Capybaras: Ziying Jian and Ivina Wang
In this project, we'll introduce the mechanics of the rail fence cipher, it's historical context, and go into the computational encode and decode algorithm. 

## Directions to Access
In the directory ```Algorithms```, you'll find the encode and decode algorithms respectively written in Python. There are test codes hard-coded into these files, but you can also input your own messages to encode/decode!

Enter the Algorithms directory
```cd Algorithms``

Run this make command in your Terminal to encode/decode a message
```make encode ARGS="<Insert your message here> <Key Num>"```
```make decode ARGS="<Insert your message here> <Key Num>"```
