# Rail Fence Cipher
## by Ziying Jian and Ivina Wang
In this project, we'll introduce the mechanics of the rail fence cipher, it's historical context, and go into the computational encode and decode algorithm. 

## Directions to Access
In the directory ```Encode``` and ```Decode```, you'll find the encode and decode algorithms respectively written in Python. There are also test cases, which you can run using the Makefile.
